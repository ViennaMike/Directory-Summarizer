# Directory-Summarizer
Summarizes all pdf, docx, .pptx, .htm, .html, and .txt files in a directory, including sub-directories as well.One of its intended uses is to generate automated summaries of all papers provided, for example, on a conference proceedings thumb drive.

The "summarizer" or "digester" script goes through all files and sub-directories in the selected source directory and automatically create a short summary of each file of a supported file type that it finds. The number of sentences to be provided in the summary is specified by the user, as is the root directory and file to write the consolidated summaries to. 

As an option, the user can select one or more specific files to summarize, rather than selecting an entire directory. 


The summary consists of the first line of the original text (which is often the title or 1st part of the title), a summary generated by sumy (see https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy and https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sumy/0.3.0) and the original path to the file.

pdfminer (http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/and https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfminer/) is used for the pdf to text conversion.

doc2text (https://github.com/DewarM/cvParser/blob/master/cvParser/doc2text.py) is used to extract text from docx files.

textract is used to extract text from .txt, .htm, .html, and .pptx files.

docx is used to write the summaries to a Word file.

Summary of Changes:
(12/26/2015): 
Added support for web page file types (.htm and .html). Now summarizes .pptx files rather than just listing them. 
Added option to select specific files to summarize, so user can choose between summarizing an entire directory tree or specifically selected files.
Replaced command line interface with simple GUI. 
Output file changed from .txt to Word (.docx). 
Added some basic error checking (e.g., now skips password-protected pdf files rather than crashing). 

(6/8/2015): Writes summaries to a single consolidated output file, rather than generating one summary file per document summarized. Easier to browse through this way.
